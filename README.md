# Hi, this is my Portfolio 

![image](images/indexsec.png)

The concept idea was to create and to show an iconic graphic that captures the essence of my achievements.
Where I am standing now, and where I will be in the future.

### HERO. section

Initial animation was created in Adobe Illustrator, moved to Adobe After Effects to apply animations, and finally exported to a data.json using Lottie AirBnb Bodymovin extension.

The design orientation was to be minimalistic, direct and clear, highlighting the Developer and Design sides.  All the communication is oriented on the double elements of creativity and technology.

### SKILLS. section

The Skills section is a breief summary of my areas of interest and experience.  

### WORKS. + EXPLORATIONS. sections

The Works and Explorations sections are showing my primary and secondary projects.  The first are elements included in my main area of interest; the second are projects that extends my main area.  

### ABOUT. section

To show further information about myself, an About section based on infographic has been created, the goal was to highlight personal aspects outside my professional areas, and also elements that drive my enthusiasm.

### CONTACT. section
